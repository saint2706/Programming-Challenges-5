# Searching the knowledge base

The backend uses Elasticsearch for full-text search. Submit a query in the search bar to find matching Markdown pages.

You can combine terms with boolean operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. Try searching for "graph" or "cross-reference" to jump to the [linking overview](linking.md).
