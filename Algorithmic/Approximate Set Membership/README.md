# Approximate Set Membership (Bloom Filter)

A space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not.

## 🧠 Theory

A **Bloom filter** is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set. The price for this efficiency is that a Bloom filter is a **probabilistic** data structure: it tells us that the element either *definitely is not* in the set or *may be* in the set.

### How It Works
1.  **Initialization**: Start with a bit array of size $m$ set to all 0s.
2.  **Adding an Item**: To add an item, feed it to $k$ different hash functions. Each function maps the item to one of the $m$ array positions. Set the bits at these positions to 1.
3.  **Checking an Item**: To check if an item is in the set, feed it to the same $k$ hash functions to get $k$ positions.
    -   If **any** of the bits at these positions is 0, the item is **definitely not** in the set.
    -   If **all** of the bits are 1, the item is **probably** in the set (though it might be a false positive).

### Optimal Parameters
-   **Size ($m$)**: Depends on the expected number of elements ($n$) and desired false positive rate ($p$).
    $$m = -\frac{n \ln p}{(\ln 2)^2}$$
-   **Hash Functions ($k$)**:
    $$k = \frac{m}{n} \ln 2$$

## 💻 Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install mmh3 matplotlib numpy seaborn manim
    ```

    *Note: `manim` is only required for the animation script (`visualize_bloom_filter.py`).*

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from bloom import BloomFilter

# Initialize with capacity of 1000 items and 1% false positive rate
bf = BloomFilter(capacity=1000, false_positive_rate=0.01)

# Add items
bf.add("apple")
bf.add("banana")

# Check items
print(bf.contains("apple"))   # True (Probably present)
print(bf.contains("carrot"))  # False (Definitely not present)
```

### Advanced Analysis

The module includes an analyzer to test actual performance against theoretical limits.

```python
from bloom import BloomFilterAnalyzer

analyzer = BloomFilterAnalyzer()
# Run comprehensive analysis across different capacities and error rates
analyzer.comprehensive_analysis()
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Add** | $O(k)$ | $O(m)$ |
| **Check** | $O(k)$ | $O(m)$ |

Where:
-   $k$ is the number of hash functions.
-   $m$ is the size of the bit array.

**Note**: The space complexity is extremely low compared to storing the actual items. For example, for a 1% false positive rate, a Bloom filter requires only about **9.6 bits per element**, regardless of the size of the elements themselves.

## 🎬 Demos

### Running the Code Demo
To see the Bloom Filter in action, including performance statistics and visualization plots:

```bash
python bloom.py
```

This will run:
1.  **Basic Functionality Demo**: Adds items and checks membership.
2.  **False Positive Rate Analysis**: Compares theoretical vs. actual error rates.
3.  **Visualization**: Plots error rates and displays the bit array heatmap.
4.  **Stress Test**: Tests with 1 million elements.
